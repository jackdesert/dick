Note that some words will have only "noun" part of speech, while others may have "noun", "verb", "adjective".

Note that there is no limit to how many definitions may exist for each part of speech.

Note that only one pronunciation mp3 is given. This is not ideal, because what about the word "lead", which means something completely different when pronounced one way than when pronounced another way?
